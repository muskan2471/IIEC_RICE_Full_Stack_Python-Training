=>
following is the steps:
1. In this task first i have to get all the system command of perticular application such as notepad, chrome, etc.
    - search for perticular application and open its file location.
    - now you see the shortcut of  application. then right click on that application and you will get the actual location of perticular application.
    - copy that path and set th environment variable. otherwise you will not able open the application from ouside.

    step 1: import package os;  because you want to communicate with OS so we can communicate with OS through commands.
    
    step 2: while user dont wnter quit
    
        step 2.1: program asks, user to talk with system.
